# Gamified CyberSecurity Awareness Game

Welcome to the **Gamified CyberSecurity Awareness Game**, an interactive educational tool designed to enhance your understanding of cybersecurity concepts through engaging challenges. Built using PyQt6, this application offers a fun way to test and improve your knowledge of secure practices, phishing detection, and more.

## Description
This game presents users with a series of scenario-based questions drawn from a JSON database (`bank.json`). Players can select the number of questions (up to 50) via a slider on the homepage, enter their name, and start the game. Each challenge includes multiple-choice options, with feedback provided after each answer. At the end, a report summarizes the total questions attempted, correct and wrong answers, and a level of understanding (Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, or Expert) based on the score.
